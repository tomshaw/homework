# Homework - Magento Boilerplate

Have you ever needed to assign your customers as students and give them homework assignments in your Magento E-commerce web site? I'm sure there's tremendous demand for this that's why I developed the Magento Homework module. In all seriousness this is a boilerplate application to quickly jump start future [Magento](http://www.magentocommerce.com/) module development. Albeit the functionality of this application is probably unnoteworthy, the techniques used to develop it are not. Goals of the project were to develop a common module application that used proven techniques to solve common problems that I can use to jump start future development. This is a great application for a begginer to learn from, and I've taken the time to make the code as straight foward as possible. Since this is just a boilerplate application I do not intend to continue development that would exceed the purpose of the project but I might consider it for some good hard cold American dinero, at the rate of $200 an hour. Just kidding. 

## Functionality

This module allows you to assign customers as students via the Magento administration customer edit or create tabs. Once a customer is assigned as a student you can begin to assign homework assignments to them. Homework assignments are created using a wysiwyg editor. You have the option to assign statuses, stores, priorities and due dates to your homework assignments. Once an assignment is completed you can grade your student customers for their efforts. Grading takes place in the edit assignment grades tab. In the Magneto Grid on the far right you'll find an input that accepts numerical values. Here you enter a number between one and 100 that represents the grade the student made. When you are done hit the save or save and continue edit button to update your changes.

## Installation Notes 

Installation of the module is quite simple.
