# Homework - Magento Boilerplate

Have you ever needed to assign your customers as students and give them homework assignments in your Magento E-commerce web site? I'm sure there's tremendous demand for this that's why I developed the Magento Homework module. In all seriousness this is a boilerplate application to quickly jump start future [Magento](http://www.magentocommerce.com/). module development. Albeit the functionality of this application is probably unnoteworthy, the techniques used to develop it are not. Goals of the project were to develop a common module application that used proven techniques to solve common problems that I can use to jump start future development. The them of the application was to develop something that probably would not prove usefull. This is a great application for a begginer to learn from, and I've taken the time to make the code as straight foward as possible. Since this is just a boilerplate application I do not intend to continue development that would exceed the prupose of the project but I might consider it for some good hard cold American dinero, at the rate of $200 an hour. Just kidding. 

## Functionality

This module allows you to assign customers as students via the Magento administration edit custom tab. Once a student is assigned as a customer you can assign them homework assignments. Homework assignmens are created using a wysiwyg editor. You have the options to assign statuses, stores, prioritiues and due dates to your homework assignments. Once an assignment is completed you can grade your student customers for their efforts. 

## Installation Notes 

Installation of the module is quite simple.

	Unzip the downloaded file into your root directory.
